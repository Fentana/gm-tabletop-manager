GM Tabletop Manager v0.0.4 (Project Shapies)
=======

What started out as a testing ground for trying out new features (such as canvas shapes) has evolved into a suite of simple tools for the Game Master of Tabletop RPGs. Hopefully this project turns out to be useful!

This is not an attempt to replace any licensed material from the publishers. This should be used as a supplement to published materials, and as such it will not include a lot of things that can be found in the official sources. Facilities may be provided to allow you to input the required content yourself.

LICENSE NOTES: This project utilises some OGL content during processing and in its output. Therefore all content outputted by this project is also covered by the OGL license, while the actual 'code' (HTML/Javascript/CSS + others) are covered by the MIT license. Both are provided in the source directory.

THANKS goes to Drow over at donjon.bin.sh and The Pathology Guy at pathguy.com for inspiration.
