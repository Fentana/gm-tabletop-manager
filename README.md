shapies
=======

A simple, barebones Javascript and HTML5 based game. What started out as a test ground for trying out new features has evolved into a simple game that aims to breed and battle 'Shapies'.

'Shapies' are fictional creatures that have (randomly generated) genetic code. You inherit some of these Shapies, and it is your quest to capture, breed and battle these Shapies.

 - Capturing involves battling a wild Shapie until it is weak, and then springing a trap. A succesful capture means the Shapie will join your growing brood!
 - Breeding involves getting two Shapies to share genetic code to form a new baby Shapie, who hopefully will inherit the best features from their parents!
 - Battling wild Shapies is necessary to harvest resources to maintain your growing brood of Shapies. Let your resources drop too low and some of your Shapies may die!
