Shapies DnD
=======

A simple, barebones Javascript and HTML5 based application. What started out as a test ground for trying out new features has evolved into a simple tools for DnD.

Notes
=======

The 'src' folder contains the uncompressed javascript files. For most purposes you will only need to use the minified versions.

 - 'Shapies.min.js' is the canvas and drawing stuff
 - 'DnD.min.js' is the DnD creature generation stuff
